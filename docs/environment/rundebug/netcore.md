# Running & Debugging (.NET Core)

The .NET Core ASP.NET project that we created on Visual Studio is empty, therefore when we start it, nothing runs. As our **forgeSample** project now contains a starting page at `wwwroot/index.html` so we should see its contents upon launch.

Visual Studio should list all browsers available in the system for you pick one to start your project. Just select one and click on the "play" icon. The browser should open with your start page.
