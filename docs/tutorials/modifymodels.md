# Modify your models

This tutorial will guide you through creating a webapp that can upload an input file, change its `width` and `height` parameter and save the output file. The UI will let you define AppBundle & Activity (as an initial configuration) and execute Workitems, with a output result. 

> Both input and output files are saved in OSS Buckets, you can use [View Models](tutorials/viewmodels) tutorial to view them.
